**liboqs-rust** offers two Rust wrappers for the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) C library, which is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

- The `oqs-sys` crate compiles and builds `liboqs` and generates `unsafe` bindings to the C library.
- The `oqs` crate offers a Rust-style safe interface to the schemes included in `liboqs`.

## Versioning

Releases up to and including release `0.9.0` of `oqs` and `oqs-sys` followed the `liboqs` versioning 1-on-1.
**Starting from release `0.9.0`, this is no longer guaranteed.**
These crates will now receive version bumps as necessary.
We will include the version number of `liboqs` that is distributed by `liboqs-sys` in the version number of `liboqs-sys`
as `0.9.0+liboqs-0.9.0`.

## Pre-requisites

`oqs-sys` depends on the [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) C library.
It will build `liboqs` automatically with the default-enabled `vendored` feature.
See below for more information.

## Contents

This crate provides unsafe `ffi` bindings in the `oqs-sys` crate, and safe wrappers are offered via the `oqs` crate.
The rendered Rustdoc documentation can be [found here](https://open-quantum-safe.github.io/liboqs-rust/oqs/)

## Usage

Update your `Cargo.toml` and include `oqs`:

```toml
[dependencies]
oqs = "0.10.1"
```

`oqs-sys` can be specified equivalently.

## Minimal builds

The default-on `kems` and `sigs` features turn on all supported KEMs and signature schemes. If you want a smaller build, turn off these default features and opt-in to individual algorithms.
Note that if you specify `default-features = false`, you may also want to re-include the `oqs-sys/openssl` feature.

## Vendored `liboqs`

By default `oqs-sys` attempts to find a system-provided version of `liboqs` and build against it,
falling back to vendored from-source build otherwise.
You can opt into forcing the vendored build by enabling the `vendored` feature.

Otherwise, if you want to force using the system-provided `liboqs`,
you can set the `LIBOQS_NO_VENDOR=1` environment variable and the build will fail if the library is not found.

## Serde support

You can enable `serde` serialization support by enabling the `serde` feature on the `oqs` crate.

## `std` support

The `oqs-sys` crate does not use `std` at all.
Note that the default features do enable building `liboqs` with `openssl`, so use `default-features = false`.

To make `oqs` a `#![no_std]` crate make sure the `std` feature is disabled.
Make sure to also disable the `oqs-sys/openssl` feature by specifying `default-features = false`.

As `default-features` includes the `kems` and `sigs` features, consider re-adding them as well. This results into:

```toml
[dependencies.oqs]
version = "*"
default-features = false
features = ["sigs", "kems"]
```

You will probably want to change the random-number generator through the [`OQS_RAND` API][] offered by `oqs-sys`.

[`OQS_RAND` API]: https://open-quantum-safe.github.io/liboqs-rust/oqs_sys/rand/index.html

## `non_portable` feature

If compiled with the `non_portable` feature, `liboqs-sys` will not enable CPU feature detection and
always use the best implementation on your current platform. This enables support for implementations
where feature detection is not functional.

## Stack usage

Some algorithms use large amounts of stack space. This means that you may need
to specify `RUST_MIN_STACK` in your environment. This for example affects
tests.

## Algorithm features

- `kems` (default): Compile with all KEMs enabled
  - `bike`
  - `classic_mceliece`
  - `frodokem`
  - `hqc`
  - `kyber`
  - `ml_kem`
  - `ntruprime`
- `sigs` (default): Compile with all signature schemes enabled
  - `cross`
  - `dilithium`
  - `falcon`
  - `mayo`
  - `ml_dsa`
  - `sphincs`: SPHINCS<sup>+</sup>

## Running

```rust
/// # Example: Some signed KEX
/// This protocol has no replay protection!
///
use oqs::*;
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let sigalg = sig::Sig::new(sig::Algorithm::Dilithium2)?;
    let kemalg = kem::Kem::new(kem::Algorithm::Kyber512)?;
    // A's long-term secrets
    let (a_sig_pk, a_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;
    // B's long-term secrets
    let (b_sig_pk, b_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;

    // assumption: A has (a_sig_sk, a_sig_pk, b_sig_pk)
    // assumption: B has (b_sig_sk, b_sig_pk, a_sig_pk)

    // A -> B: kem_pk, signature
    let (kem_pk, kem_sk) = kemalg.keypair()?;
    let signature = sigalg.sign(kem_pk.as_ref(), &a_sig_sk)?;

    // B -> A: kem_ct, signature
    sigalg.verify(kem_pk.as_ref(), &signature, &a_sig_pk)?;
    let (kem_ct, b_kem_ss) = kemalg.encapsulate(&kem_pk)?;
    let signature = sigalg.sign(kem_ct.as_ref(), &b_sig_sk)?;

    // A verifies, decapsulates, now both have kem_ss
    sigalg.verify(kem_ct.as_ref(), &signature, &b_sig_pk)?;
    let a_kem_ss = kemalg.decapsulate(&kem_sk, &kem_ct)?;
    assert_eq!(a_kem_ss, b_kem_ss);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Limitations and security

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography. Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms. liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project. We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.
